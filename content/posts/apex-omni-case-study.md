ApeX Omni is a high-performance perpetual futures DEX with up to 50x leverage, cross-collateral margin, and omnichain liquidity via zkLink. The platform supports 100+ trading pairs with sub-second execution and advanced order types.

## The Challenge

Building a decentralized perpetual trading platform requires balancing the speed and reliability traders expect from centralized exchanges with the transparency and security of on-chain settlement. The platform needed to handle high-frequency trading volumes while maintaining strict security standards.

## What We Built

We delivered a full-featured perpetual futures DEX that combines the performance of centralized exchanges with the trustlessness of DeFi:

- **Cross-collateral margin system** supporting multiple assets as collateral
- **Omnichain liquidity** via zkLink for deep order books across chains
- **Advanced order types** including limit, market, stop-loss, and take-profit
- **Real-time portfolio tracking** with P&L calculations and risk metrics
- **Sub-second execution** with optimistic transaction processing

## Key Metrics

- **TVL:** $500M+
- **Monthly Traders:** 50K+
- **Uptime:** 99.9%

## Tech Stack

Solidity, React, TypeScript, zkLink, Web3
